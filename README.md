# MileStone 1 Project (Reptile Hotel)


Based (with information and permissions to use there brand) on a local reptile specialist pet shop [Reptile Hotel](http://www.thereptilehotel.co.uk/).

I'm creating the site to inform their customers of the services and products offered.

I'm also using the site to help the company create and maintain a sense of community using the CareSheets/gallery pages. 
 

 The current website for reptile hotel is missing a lot of important information, my aim it to fix this problem, through user stories and agile design.
## UX
 
### User Stories.

User A ~ I am a new customer with an existing pet looking for a new pet supply store so I can feed and care for my reptiles

User B ~ As a new pet owner I need to find a place to but pet supplies so I can travel there and purchase them.

User C ~ As the Owner of a pet with specialist dietary needs I need to know if a potential store can find and supply for these needs

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Home/Landing Page ~ on the home page I'm going to have a brief outline of the Store, including its history and a brief outling of their services.

Nav Bar ~ The Nav bar will be un-obtrusive when the user scrolls down the page.

The footer~ the footer will be repeated on each page and will include the contact details , social media accounts and a map to the stores location.

        The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

During the testing phase I spent time Working on the responsive design element.

I tested this by using google chromes dev tools and changing the width of the screen,  
I then used a combination of Bootstrap 4's grid system and media queries.

On the contact page I designed and created the form with validation in mind, To this end I checked that the contact form worked using
code institutes form validation tester "https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/". Once it return the correct information I changed it to the modal.

Once all coding was done I ran the code through the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). after running the test on each  file I fixed any errors given and the files are now validated.

## Deployment

This Project is deployed on Github pages, each push updates the page so it is at least a commit behind. To do this I pushed the code to Github and in the settings I scrolled down to the web host section and enabled the website.
